//  within the components to updates in the navigation panel.
// A simple example would be that browsing to a new category
//  (say from 'main courses' to 'desserts') within the app would also
//  make then new category active in the navigation panel.
// I also like to store user data in the store, that is the user ID,
//  name and localization.

    //  the mutation if you want.
